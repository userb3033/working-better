#IMPORTANT:  Once working-better.sh is running, you won't be able to run this by opening a terminal because
#the mouse and window focus will be all over the place.  So you need to follow the instructions in the
#README for setting up a Shortcut Key.  I use the Windows key.  One key press will trigger this script and
#stop working-better.sh, returning your computer to not being possessed.  

killall -9 working-better.sh
